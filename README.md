<h1>My high school little project</h1>
<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>This project is a sequel from a previous one. Essentially was a multi-task software to help students preparing a "study run".</p>
<p>If you want to run you'll need Visual Studio to build the program and then test.</p>
<p>I pretend to make a mobile app in the future.</p>
